Huge props to whomever created a scale model of Chicago in Minecraft
(http://imgur.com/gallery/AiCND).  I tried to make a single .schematic
file to import the entire map, but it didn't work.. probably too big
for MCEdit.  So I broke it up in to 8 schematics.  The eighth is but a
sliver between the 6th and 7th.  Though I highly doubt anyone will
care, it's relatively trivial to archive them here.
